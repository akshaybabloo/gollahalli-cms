## Introduction

I have been sick of complicated CMS, so I set out to develop a micro-CMS. A very simple one-page website creator that supports Django Templates and GraphQL API calls.

For extra security, I have included Authy's two-factor authentication with Django's built-in user authentication system.

## Requirements

This library heavily depends on the following services:

1. Heroku (web deployment)
2. Amazon AWS S3 (storage) - That's because Heroku doesnt provide storage system.
3. Authy (Two-factor authentication)
4. Cloudinary (Optional, for images)
